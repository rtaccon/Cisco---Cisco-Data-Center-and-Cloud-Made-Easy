**Module 3 - Episode 4: ACI Integration and Migration from Legacy Networks and Brownfield Environments**
Are you ready to integrate your new ACI network to your existing environment? In this chapter we'll learn how to do so by connecting a new ACI network and gradually migrate your existing services  as seamlessly as possible. We'll go through some general recommendations and some specific scenarios such as DHCP considerations, VMware ESX server migrations, migrating from an external gateway to an ACI Anycast gateway, L4-L7 services migration recommendations and more. Finally, we will briefly cover how BPDUs are treated in ACI and some recommendations to ensure your migration to ACI is a successful one
Please also keep in mind that changing from the Bridge Domain settings from Hardware Proxy to Flooding bounces the associated interfaces, therefore a slight disruption (2 to 3 lost pings) is expected when performing such change

**Module 3 - Episode 5: Best Practices (Snapshots, vzAny, Preferred Groups, ESGs, Inheritance & more)**
In the last chapter of this module, we'll cover some best practices to help you along the way. We'll start with Snapshots and Rollbacks to protect your configuration from unwanted changes and complicated troubleshooting, restoring the network in seconds. Then we'll move to how ACI works in terms of deployment and resolution immediacy plus a few ways to optimize TCAM utilization with concepts such as Unenforced VRF, vzAny and Preferred Groups. We will also take a glimpse into Contract Inheritance and Policy Compression as well as the new End-Point Security Groups (ESGs) which became available in ACI 5.0. Last, we will compare static EPG binding versus L2 Out as methods to integrate external L2 connectivity into ACI

**Configuring Logical networking in the Cloud (target technical)**

**Module 3.1 - Episode 1 (Part 1/2): Cloud 101 for Network Engineers**
Before we get started with Cloud ACI, its benefits and configuration, we'll cover in the first part of this episode some of the main concepts in the cloud. We'll start with IaaS, PaaS and SaaS terminology for each of the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure and Google) and cover some key concepts like Regions and Availability Zones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsFxKIc4R1w

**Module 3.1 - Episode 1 (Part 2/2): Cloud 101 for Network Engineers**
In the second part of this video, we will now take a brief look into the different infrastructure services on each cloud as well as an overview of how we can connect to and from the cloud (either through VPN or dedicated physical connections). We will briefly cover how each service is charged and we will also learn how to create a key pair in order to use it to SSH into a cloud instance on AWS EC2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpdtbll-Rw0

**Module 3.1 - Episode 2: Cloud Networking Overview**
In this chapter we will go through some of the main cloud networking concepts using AWS as reference. We will start by defining and briefly showing the configuration of VPCs, IGWs, Routing Tables, Private and Public Subnets, Security Groups and NACLs, and then we will also cover some of the Inter-VPC, Inter-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud connectivity options that exist such as VPC Peering, VGW + CSR1000v, TGW and Direct Connect just to name a few. Cloud networking constructs for Azure and Google Cloud will also be covered in further chapters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJnoppNdKr4&t=19s

**Module 3.1 - Episode 3: Cloud ACI Overview (Part 1/2) - Cloud APIC deployment**
In this first part of this chapter we will go through the Cloud ACI deployment basics by comparing it against the on-premises ACI version, understanding what happens behind the scenes when you subscribe to Cloud APIC on AWS or Azure, the different connectivity options and the licensing model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fCx0XWfrkI&t=8s

**Module 3.1 - Episode 3: Cloud ACI Overview (Part 2/2) - Cloud APIC Logical Network Overview**
In the second part of this chapter we'll take it a bit deeper and we will the main concepts on what changes in terms of the logical network in Cloud ACI. We'll start with Tenants and VRFs (introducing a new concept called Cloud Context), then we'll briefly touch upon the automation Cloud APIC performs to provide inter VPC/VNet and Inter-Region connectivity and we'll finish with the main differences in terms of EPGs when comparing to on-prem environments.
Not sure if it is clear on the video, but as you would imagine there are no Bridge Domains associated to EPGs in the Cloud (remember all communications in the cloud are L3-based) and external connectivity is provided directly by IGW (AWS) and the integrated gateway and routes in Azure.
