**\*Module 3 - Episode 4: ACI Integration and Migration from Legacy Networks and Brownfield Environments**
Are you ready to integrate your new ACI network to your existing environment? In this chapter we'll learn how to do so by connecting a new ACI network and gradually migrate your existing services  as seamlessly as possible. We'll go through some general recommendations and some specific scenarios such as DHCP considerations, VMware ESX server migrations, migrating from an external gateway to an ACI Anycast gateway, L4-L7 services migration recommendations and more. Finally, we will briefly cover how BPDUs are treated in ACI and some recommendations to ensure your migration to ACI is a successful one
Please also keep in mind that changing from the Bridge Domain settings from Hardware Proxy to Flooding bounces the associated interfaces, therefore a slight disruption (2 to 3 lost pings) is expected when performing such change

We'll start with Snapshots and Rollbacks to protect your configuration from unwanted changes and complicated troubleshooting, restoring the network in seconds. Then we'll move to how ACI works in terms of deployment and resolution immediacy plus a few ways to optimize TCAM utilization with concepts such as Unenforced VRF, vzAny and Preferred Groups. We will also take a glimpse into Contract Inheritance and Policy Compression as well as the new End-Point Security Groups (ESGs) which became available in ACI 5.0. Last, we will compare static EPG binding versus L2 Out as methods to integrate external L2 connectivity into ACI

**\*Cloud Ready ! (target technical)**

**\*Seamless Cloud Migration & Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) with AWS CloudEndure and Cisco ACI**
In this video, German Gonzalez from AWS and Carlos Campos Torres from Cisco show you how to perform DRaaS and Cloud Migration in a cost-effective and cloud-native way for both DNS-based apps and for legacy apps which IP addresses need to be preserved. 
We will show the topology, the configuration on both CloudEndure and MSO and how we can either use AWS Route53 to automatically failover DNS-based apps or we even preserve your same IP addressing once in the cloud and totally seamless to the users. 
This translates into central management for all network types and without "stretching" your subnet from on-prem, which brings multiple drawbacks such as traffic tromboning, sub-optimal routing and even the need for proprietary solutions which eliminate your ability to use cloud-native services
